```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This file runs uses files: 
* height_calc_funcs.R
* read_files_funcs.R
* load_funcs.R

to calculate heights from .las files and add them to their corresponding heights. These tiles are then output to a new file with the same name as the tile with "height_added" prepended on the filename. 

## Load functions
```{r}
source("R/load_funcs.R")
```

Add height to all of the tiles. 
```{r}
list_of_tiles<-list.files('DATA/SanMiguel_West/Tiffs', pattern = ".tif", full.names = T)

lapply(list_of_tiles, calcadd_heights, "DATA/SanM_W_LAS", "DATA/SanMiguel_West_heights_added")
```

This worked!
